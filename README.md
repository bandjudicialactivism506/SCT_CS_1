## 📖 Description

SCT_CS_1 is a Python program that uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. This tool lets you enter any message along with a shift value to securely encrypt or decrypt it. With a simple substitution cipher, SCT_CS_1 demonstrates basic cryptographic concepts, making it easy to understand and use for anyone.

## 👌 Features

- **Easy to Use**: Just enter your text and shift value.
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Encrypt messages to keep them secure, or decrypt them to read.
- **Visual Output**: See results displayed clearly.
- **Python Based**: Utilizes Python, a widely-used programming language.

## 💻 System Requirements

To use SCT_CS_1, you need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
